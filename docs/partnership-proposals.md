## Follow-Up Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Send initial emails to all three organizations
- Follow up with phone calls if contact numbers are available

**Week 2-3:**
- If no response, send polite follow-up emails
- Explore LinkedIn connections for warm introductions

**Week 4:**
- If still no response, consider alternative approaches:
  - Attend live races and network with media/staff
  - Connect with riders or team managers on social media
  - Explore third-party data licensing options

**Backup Plan:**
If partnerships are not secured within 30 days, pivot to manual data entry model where app admins enter race information manually from publicly available sources.

---

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT implement any automated scraping** while waiting for partnership responses
- **Keep all communications professional and persistent but not pushy**
- **Be prepared to offer financial terms** (revenue sharing, licensing fees, etc.)
- **Have app demo ready** to show during any calls or meetings
- **Document all communications** for legal protection
