## Compliant Data Access Strategies

### ‚úÖ Strategy 1: Official Partnership (RECOMMENDED)

- Can start immediately

**Disadvantages:**
- Labor intensive

## Fair Use Analysis

### Could MotoSense Claim Fair Use?

**Fair Use Factors (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 107):**

1. **Purpose and character of use**
   - ‚úÖ Educational purpose
   - ‚ùå Commercial app (even if free)
   - ‚ùå Not transformative enough

2. **Nature of copyrighted work**
   - ‚ùå Factual data (less protection than creative works)
   - ‚úÖ Published/public information

3. **Amount and substantiality**
   - ‚ùå Using complete datasets (schedules, results)
   - ‚ùå Core data necessary for rights holder's business

4. **Effect on market**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Could increase viewership (positive effect)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Could compete with official apps (negative effect)
   - ‚ùå Using without permission undermines licensing market

**CONCLUSION:** Fair use claim is weak and risky. Not recommended as legal defense strategy.
