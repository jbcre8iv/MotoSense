## What's Next (Priority Order)

### Phase 2 - AI & Results
1. **Claude API Integration**
   - Generate AI predictions for races
   - Provide reasoning and confidence scores
   - Compare user predictions to AI

2. **Race Results Entry**
   - Manual entry interface
   - Store results in local database
   - Calculate prediction accuracy

3. **Accuracy Calculation**
   - Compare predictions to actual results
   - Update user accuracy percentage
   - Track performance over time

### Phase 3 - Gamification
4. **Achievement System**
   - Implement badge logic
   - Award achievements based on milestones
   - Display earned badges in profile

5. **Notifications**
   - Race reminders (2 hours before)
   - Results posted notifications
   - Weather alerts for track conditions

### Phase 4 - Content & Features
6. **Rider Profiles**
   - Detailed rider information
   - Career statistics
   - Performance by track
   - Social media integration

7. **Historical Data**
   - Past race results
   - Rider performance trends
   - Track history

8. **Educational Content**
   - Articles about track reading
   - Racing strategy guides
   - Weather impact explained

### Phase 5 - Polish
9. **Enhanced UI**
   - Custom icons
   - Rider photos
   - Track layout images
   - Animations and transitions

10. **SQLite Migration**
    - Move from AsyncStorage to SQLite
    - Better performance for large datasets
    - Complex queries support

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- Weather.gov API only works for US locations
- No real-time race data (waiting for API)
- Mock data only (5 riders, 2 races)
- No cloud sync (local only)
- No user authentication
- Weather API can be slow or timeout

### Technical Debt
- Need to move WeatherCard to parent dir structure (currently nested)
- Should add loading states to all screens
- Error boundaries needed
- Need retry logic for failed API calls

---

## Testing Checklist

### Before Release
- [ ] Test on iOS device
- [ ] Test on Android device
- [ ] Test on web browser
- [ ] Test offline mode
- [ ] Test with slow network
- [ ] Test with no predictions
- [ ] Test with many predictions (100+)
- [ ] Test weather API timeout handling
- [ ] Test storage quota limits

### User Scenarios
- [ ] New user onboarding
- [ ] Making first prediction
- [ ] Making multiple predictions
- [ ] Viewing weather in different locations
- [ ] Checking profile stats
- [ ] App backgrounding and returning

## How to Test

### Quick Test
```bash
npx expo start
```
Then scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone.

### Full Test Sequence
1. **First Launch**: App creates default user profile
2. **Home Screen**: Check weather loads for both tracks
3. **Predictions**: Select 5 different riders, submit
4. **Profile**: Verify Racing IQ increased, total predictions = 1
5. **Predictions**: Submit another prediction
6. **Profile**: Verify Racing IQ level 2, total predictions = 2

---

## Performance Notes

### Current Performance
- Initial load: ~2-3 seconds
- Weather API: 2-5 seconds per track
- Predictions submit: <100ms
- Screen transitions: Smooth

### Optimization Opportunities
- Cache weather data (reduce API calls)
- Lazy load images when added
- Virtualize long lists
- Optimize re-renders

---

## Dependencies

### Production
- expo (~54.0.0)
- react-native
- react-navigation
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- axios
- react-native-paper
- expo-sqlite

### Dev
- typescript
- @types/react
- @types/react-native

---

## API Keys Needed

### Current
- Weather.gov: ✅ No key needed

### Future
- Claude API: You'll provide key for AI predictions
- Live timing API: TBD

---

## Notes for Developer

### Good Decisions
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture
- Service layer abstraction
- Dark theme from start
- Free APIs only

### Could Improve
- Add PropTypes/interfaces for all components
- More granular error handling
- Loading states everywhere
- Unit tests (none yet)
- E2E tests (none yet)

## Next Session TODO

**High Priority:**
1. Test app on actual device
2. Add Claude API integration
3. Build results entry screen
4. Calculate accuracy

**Medium Priority:**
5. Add more riders (expand to 20+)
6. Add full 2025 schedule
7. Implement notifications

**Low Priority:**
8. Add rider photos
9. Create custom app icon
10. Polish animations
